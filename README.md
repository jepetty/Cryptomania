##Files
- ```lorenz.txt```: text file containing 500,000 data entries for the Lorenz data set

##To do:
- [ ] Make cryptographic key

##Update:
Bonus to using data that I've generated rather than data found in nature: much less inconsistencies. Now we're dealing only with numerical noise rather than sensor noise AND nature noise. I'm a couple sample sets and the code so we can get started.
